Rachita Chakraborty - Narula Institute of Technology

This project is part of my AICTE internship on cybersecurity, focusing on steganography.
I've used - python3, cv2 library, os and string library.

Features -
✅ Secure Encryption – Protects hidden data using strong cryptographic algorithms.
✅ Image Quality Preservation – Ensures minimal distortion after embedding data.
✅ Attack Resistance – Designed to withstand steganalysis and hacking attempts.

Project Structure -
📄 Presentation (PPT) – Explains the methodology, implementation, and results.
💻 Code – Core implementation of the steganography system.
🔍 Object File – Compiled object.
